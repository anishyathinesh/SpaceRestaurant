# SpaceRestaurant
A fun website for a concept restaurant in space. My first deep dive into HTML/CSS web dev. Worked on from August 2020-early 2021

The last feature I remember trying to add was a radio station. However I thought it strayed away from the theme of a aimple concept restaurant and moreover I couldn't get it to work. LOL
